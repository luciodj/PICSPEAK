# PICSPEAK
A rudimentary voice synthesiser in less than 1K of code.
A very old project of mine, resurrected from the compost drawer where it has been rotting for the last 22 years (sigh)! 
Originally (see 1994 sources) it was based on an 18-pin PIC16CR56 (!) and used 24 resistors to create an (R-2R) poor man DAC. 
It would "say" the (Italian) world "SISTEMA" ( don't ask, long story) using less than 1K byte of code (582 x 12-bit PIC words = *12/8 = 873 bytes)
I intend to port it to a (bit) more modern microcontroller model, possibly in a smaller package and see what/how I can improve in the process...
